# the game of go fish everyone start with 7 cards out of 52 with  4 players max. 
# exta once the cards go into pond deck to be pulled out when the player 
# player will ask bot for a numder of a card igoring suit. 4 of same numder is need. 
# if they do not have that num card then they will pick from the pond.If they do bot will give the card.
# move to next player bot they get to ask other players(bot or main player) a numder at random. 
# untill the person with the empty their hand first wins.
